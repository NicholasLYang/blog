Image uploading officially works!!! Basic post tagging is also working. The blog is starting to really look pretty good (feature wise, aesthetically it's still pretty meh). Next up is probably some more CSS/JS. I've discovered Opal, which looks pretty awesome and allows me to avoid JavaScript (though I definitely should learn it properly). I'll try to add post publishing, so that I can stage my posts before they're displayed. 

There's this idea that hackathon projects should be messy, half finished, undertakings. They should work in appearance but break down upon inspection. I disagree. This misconception assumes that working on concepts such as orthogonality and clean code will distract from the larger issues. And to an extent this is true; following a 15 page style guide for a hackathon isn't necessary. And maintainability should not and often is not a central issue at a hackathon. But the concepts of good code isn't just for maintainability. One of the core values of good code is conservation of brain power. As your team builds your application, it's easy to ignore simple issues, like consistent case for variables. As a result, every time you use code written by a different member of a team, you have to constantly remember which case to use. This may seem negligible, but add on inconsistent variable names, schemas, even looping, and the amount of minutiae you have to remember grows exponentially.
